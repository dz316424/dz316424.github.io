Note on the keynote of 25th GIS/SIG annual conference
=====================================================

In today's [GIS/SIG annual conference (Pittsford, NY)](http://gis-sig.org/conference/), the very impressive keynote is given by Steve Coast, known as the founder of [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org). In this keynote *The Past, Present, and Future of OpenStreetMap*, Steve shares the exciting history of OpenStreetMap's rapid growth and discussed the theory behind the open map's success.

Close Map vs. Open Map
----------------------

The story of OpenStreetMap dates back to the mid-2000, when the printed map was still the mainstream and the close source online map started to emerge. Like many startup stories today, the idea of map created by everyone was because of Steve's dissatisfaction of this or that problem of the existing products.

Although publishing the map on the web had pushed the convenience of usage a lot, it just changed the way of publicaition and did inherited many problems originated from printed map. And Steve simply listed three with his own experience.

The first one was about the quantity and quality of map data. I am sure most GIS people aren't unfamiliar with this problem since we are spending our whole career life on looking for high quality data: whether they exist, how is the quality, and how to deliver. At the time when OpenStreetMap was just established, there was on publicly available (and very affordable) road network data in the western Europe and not to mention those developing countries.

The second problem is about the update frequency of map data. Steve told a very funny about the Yahoo! Map and a bridge washed away by flood. Guess how long did Yahoo! Map to update the map: 6 month to confirm the accident + 6 month to validate and publish data = 1 year in which noboday could route to the right way.

**There is a bridge on the Yahoo! Map! It must exist! (well, in fact not)**

The third problem was the copyright of map data. Like a secret convention of mapping industry, many map producers would add some unrealistic map markers (e.g faked roads) to identify their products. These markers were usually placed to some generally unnoticed places. But as man itself is pretty unpredictable, there were always people living beyond the 'general thinking' and affected by these faked markers for copyright.

Inspired by the Wikipedia, the OpenStreetMap aimed to the revisable open map data created by everyone. The OpenStreetMap at the earliest day was actually awful compared to all existing products. Just image the first contributor in Europe started from nothing but the coast line.

As OpenStreetMap's user increased rapidly, the visible data on the map increased rapidly as well. On the other handle, the more complete data was attracting more people to use and contribute to the map.

Theory of Innovation
--------------------

OK, so what made the OpenStreetMap so successful?

Steve concluded it in the following three points:

-	Fun. OpenStreetMap tries hard to make the mapping more friendly and have more fun. (and then more addictive!!!)

-	Easy.

Next Map?
