I am pleased to announce that [OpenDataDiscovery.org](http://www.opendatadiscovery.org/) is now tracking more than 1,000 open data portals, 40% of data portals in the world!

A map of all recorded 329 cities / provinces / countries worldwide, in which each color category includes 20% of all portals.

Thanks to [OpenDataSoft](https://www.opendatasoft.com/)'s comprehensive open data portal survey (see [their blog](https://opendatainception.io/)), I am able to quickly identify a list of important open data service providers. So far seven major open data service providers have been supported:

* [ArcGIS Open Data](http://opendata.arcgis.com/) (595 portals, 26,281 datasets)
* [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) (89 portals, 842,154 datasets)
* [DKAN](http://www.nucivic.com/dkan/) (40 portals, 14,289 datasets)
* [GeoNode](http://geonode.org/) (10 portals, 9,604 datasets)
* [Junar](http://junar.com) (11 portals, 1,860 datasets)
* [OpenDataSoft](https://www.opendatasoft.com/) (79 portals, 6,084 datasets)
* [Socrata](http://socrata.com/) (177 portals, 110,130 datasets)

As of 01/16/2017, the total number of datasets opened at these portals is more than 1 million! Also, thousands of data categories and publishers, and nearly a million data tags have been identified. This project just reveals an immense and existing world of open data and all these numbers are still likely to be underestimated.

For the following months, I will focus on analyzing the existing/coming data and building better data visualization. As the portal level metadata collection procedure is close to done, it is also time to explore the collection of the dataset level metadata.

I can wait to work on it to see what story this data is telling!
